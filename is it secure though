#Is_It_Secure_Tho??
from the despription got a hint that the trnsfered file was insecure basically pointing out that the possible protocols are http, tcp.
and when searched for possible flag terms, there was a file which had wired in their details 
and found wired%7Bs3cur3_4_ev4%7D
which was in am html form and converted it into ascii it was chown wired{s3cur3_4_ev4}
command:
ctrl +F
  packet details
  string
  wired
result :
  wired%7Bs3cur3_4_ev4%7D
and  converted it into ascii
flag : wired{s3cur3_4_ev4}
