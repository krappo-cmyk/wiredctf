This is one of the question which confused me , when i tried to open the image provided 
It wasnt openeing so i tried to open it using the terminal, then it wasnt in the human readable form, then i checked the kind of file it were using file commad then it gave me it is an hexadump file ,the piucture had an header as png file but it's an hexadump file.
then i converted it few times , then i used hexcurse and altered the first line which was for the header and corrected it. then i veiwed and the flag was found
