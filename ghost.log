first they had given us  a file called ghost.log
after opening it i found "(1724973000.061585) vcan0 26C#E26225635016C025"
then i searched about it on chat gpt and found what each part of this line meant
there were a hint given that, there were message hidden in vehicles rpm messages , and i searched about ford mustang s550's CAN database
and found that the CAN ID(hex) of rpm of the car is 200 then , i searched using grep for 200 in ghost.log
and got 
(1724973002.471613) vcan0 200#77697265647B3370
(1724973004.283982) vcan0 200#737433696E5F6431
