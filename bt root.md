Bt_Root
firstly i opened this file  using wireshark and then saw many  random packets .
just randomly scrolled and found many similar packets after rolling for around thousand packets i found a packet send in txt format called gattacker.txt
so i opened it after randomly reading for an everithing that was in readable found a hint called hail king harold; then an idea came to my mind, even the name of the challenge was bt-root.
i already knew a fact that the name bluetooth was inspired from the  name of a king , king harald bluetooth , and then i entered this in the flag translator provided.
