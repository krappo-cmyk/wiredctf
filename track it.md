the file provided was in squash format so i unsquashed it,the unsquashed file was called squashfs-root
and i opened it, and then after that just took look of the whole file, and there was an obvious  file squashfs-root
i opened it then  searched for "deriw" ("just reversal of thought :)")
and got a list of important dates of important celebs, i sorted the dates first ,then and i found the difference between the 5 digit numbers and found out that we could convert it into an ascci value and found the flag
